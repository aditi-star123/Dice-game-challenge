# Dice-game-challenge
I built a Dice Game Project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Dice Game is based on a two-player. Both players roll the dice and the player who gets the highest phase value will win the game.

Images of Dice Phases: The list of dice phases are used and  saved all the images in a folder where I saved  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. I  saved all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files separately and linked CSS and JavaScript files to the HTML file .
