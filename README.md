# Dice-game-challenge
I built a Dice Game Project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Dice Game is based on a two-player. Both the players roll the dice and the player who gets the highest phase value will win the game. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are built and linked CSS and JavaScript files to the HTML file.
